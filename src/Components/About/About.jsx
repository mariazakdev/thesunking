        “Sun King" will be a large-scale theatrical production, requiring a team
        of talented actors, dancers, musicians, set designers, and costume
        designers. The show will feature original music composed specifically
        for the production, intricate costumes, and stunning visual effects.
        Overall, the production will involve over 40 artists from mixed
        ethnicities mostly Canadians. There is a focus to have a multicultural
        cast, reflecting Canada’s evolving mainstream audience. Compose a
        captivating theme song for the Egyptian epic ballad, "The Sun King,"
        that evokes a sense of grandeur, power, and ancient mystique. The music
        should seamlessly intertwine traditional Egyptian elements with modern
        orchestration, creating an immersive experience that complements the
        epic narrative.
